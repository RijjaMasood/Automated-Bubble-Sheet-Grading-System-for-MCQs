# Automated-Bubble-Sheet-Grading-System-for-MCQs
 
### **Repository Description**  

This repository contains an **Automated Bubble Sheet Grading System** for multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The program is designed to process a bubble sheet with **10 MCQs** and evaluate the answers using advanced image processing techniques. It can differentiate between:  

- **Correctly filled bubbles**  
- **Incorrectly filled bubbles**  
- **Multiple filled bubbles** (resulting in penalties)

### **Key Features**  
- **Automated Grading**: Efficient detection and grading of MCQ answers.  
- **Negative Marking Support**: Penalizes wrong and multiple selections.  
- **Contour Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect and process bubble contours.  
- **Customizable Answer Key**: Easily modify the answer key for different tests.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Marks correct answers in **green** and incorrect/multiple answers in **red** for easy identification.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

This project is ideal for educators and institutions looking to streamline the grading process of MCQ-based assessments.
